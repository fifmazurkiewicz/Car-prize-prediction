# Car-prize-prediction
## Purpose
The notebook was prepared as part of a course credit for Machine Learning. 

## Description

The notebook uses data from otomoto, which was made available on the Kaggle platform https://www.kaggle.com/bartoszpieniak/poland-cars-for-sale-dataset?select=Car_sale_ads.csv. In addition, I prepared a representation of the dataset and basic statistical tests. For the machine learning models themselves, I applied most of the columns. For the comparison of linear regression results (considering various modifications such as Ridge, Lasso, Bayesian, ElasticNet) and the XGBoost boosting model, I prepared graphs and determined R^2 and RMSE metrics. In addition, the best model was saved and tested for one of the offers from the OTOMOTO portal.
